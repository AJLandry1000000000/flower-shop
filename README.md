Explain why i am using a recursive function. use the example of order for 14 and bundles = [9, 3, 2] (in this example, simply using the largest bundle and subtracting that from the order number, does not lead to a solution)

Explain why I hardcoded the data, and that in reality we would use a database table.

Assumption: There needs to be an exact solution. We cannot over charge them by giving them more flowers. WHAT IF WE WANTED TO ALLOW OVER CHARGING?


Build a recursive solution which starts with the biggest bundles and backtracks when a solution doesn't work, to test the next smallest bundle (one up the recursion chain).

CONSIDER EDGE CASES!

TEST WITH INVALID COMBINATIONS!
